# Configuration Requirements for Enterprise Agent System

## Overview
The enterprise agent system requires specific configuration to ensure proper operation and safety measures.

## Required Configurations

### 1. .gitignore Configuration
Copy the requirements from [.gitignore-requirements.md](./.gitignore-requirements.md) to ensure all agent artifacts are preserved in version control.

**Key Points:**
- All `.notes/` content must be tracked
- Preserve all `.md`, `.diff`, and test files
- Maintain audit trail of agent decisions and implementations

### 2. Claude Code Settings (settings.local.json)
Copy [settings.local.json](./settings.local.json) to your repository root to configure Claude Code behavior.

**Key Features:**
- **Prevents git commit/push operations** by agents
- **Requires human approval** for version control changes
- **Preserves agent artifacts** in .notes directories
- **Blocks dangerous git operations** that could disrupt workflow

### 3. Safety Measures

#### Git Operation Restrictions
The configuration prevents agents from:
- `git commit` operations
- `git push` operations  
- `git commit --amend`
- `git push --force`
- Any version control changes without human approval

#### Human Oversight Requirements
Agents will be blocked from:
- Making commits without explicit human approval
- Pushing changes to remote repositories
- Modifying git history or repository state

#### Workflow Safety
The system ensures:
- All agent outputs are preserved
- Human review is required for final implementation
- Version control operations require explicit approval
- Agent artifacts are maintained for audit trail

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy .gitignore entries** to your repository's `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   cat agents/configuration/.gitignore-requirements.md >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Copy settings.local.json** to your repository root:
   ```bash
   cp agents/configuration/settings.local.json ./settings.local.json
   ```

3. **Verify configuration** works correctly:
   ```bash
   # Test that git operations are blocked
   claude --agent pull-agent "Try to commit changes" # Should be blocked
   ```

## Why These Configurations Matter

### Version Control Safety
- Prevents agents from making unauthorized commits
- Ensures human oversight of all repository changes
- Maintains clean git history with intentional commits

### Audit Trail Preservation  
- All agent decisions and implementations are tracked
- Historical context preserved for future reference
- Team collaboration enabled through shared artifacts

### Process Integrity
- Clear separation between agent work and human decision-making
- Human controls all workflow progression between agents
- Quality gates enforced at critical points
- Consistent workflow across all enterprise tickets

## Troubleshooting

### If agents are blocked from git operations
This is expected behavior! The configuration is working correctly to require human oversight.

### If .notes files are not being tracked
Check your .gitignore configuration and ensure the inclusion rules are properly formatted.

### If settings are not taking effect
Verify settings.local.json is in the repository root and properly formatted JSON.
