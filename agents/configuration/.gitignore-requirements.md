# .gitignore Requirements for Enterprise Agent System

## Required .gitignore Entries

**Human Setup Required**: You (the human) must manually add these entries to your repository's `.gitignore` file. Claude agents will respect and preserve these settings but cannot modify .gitignore themselves:

```gitignore
# Enterprise agent workspace - preserve all agent data
!.notes/
!.notes/**/*.md
!.notes/**/*.diff
!.notes/**/*.js
!.notes/**/*.ts
!.notes/**/*.py
!.notes/**/*.json

# Ensure .notes directory and all contents are tracked
# This includes:
# - All markdown files (.md)
# - All diff files (.diff) 
# - All test scripts and artifacts
# - All planning and review documents
```

## Rationale

The `.notes/` directory contains critical enterprise workflow data:

- **Source of truth data** in `pull/` directory
- **Strategic planning** in `plan/` directory  
- **Quality assurance** in `review/` directory
- **Implementation artifacts** and diffs
- **Test scripts and validation results**

This data should be preserved in version control to:
1. Maintain audit trail of decisions and implementations
2. Enable team collaboration on enterprise tickets
3. Provide historical context for future iterations
4. Support knowledge sharing and process improvement

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer more granular control, you (the human) can manually set up explicit inclusion:

```gitignore
# Human adds to .gitignore
.notes/*
*.md # prevents CLAUDE.md being committed.
```

**Important**: These .gitignore configurations are managed by humans only. Claude agents:
- **Will respect** existing .gitignore settings
- **Cannot modify** .gitignore files 
- **Must work within** whatever .gitignore rules humans have established

This ensures all agent outputs are preserved while allowing humans full control over repository version control policies.
